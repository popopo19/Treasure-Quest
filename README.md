##**Game Title: Monster Maze**

**Description Game:** Monster maze is a rouge-like, adventure maze game with a maze that is randomized every time the player plays. The goal of the game is to find the secret golden treasure room and then try and find the buried treasure in the golden room. It starts out with the main menu screen showcasing the “Treasure Quest” title and three buttons. The start button begins the game, controls button which provides the instructions to the game, and an exit button that quits the game. Throughout the entirety of the game, the player can press the ‘p’ key to pause the game and when pressed, the game freezes and three buttons appear. A resume button that will resume the game where the player left off appears. A controls button that provides the instructions to the game if the player needs to see the game instructions again while playing the game. And a quit button to quit the game if they ever want to quit in the middle of the game. The character is moved by the arrow keys and is unable to get out of the walls of the maze. When the player finds the golden room and finds the buried treasure by walking around the room till they are over the buried treasure which then causes them to win the game and the congratulations screen appears. Telling the player congrats for winning the game and that they had found the treasure. On the screen, there are two buttons, a ‘quit’ button allowing the player to quit the game appears and a ‘play again’ button will also appear. And when the ‘play again’ button is pressed our game will create an entirely new randomly generated maze not take the player back to the main menu screen.
